<div style="clear:both;"></div>Hey, my good friend Carey from Skidmore is <a href="http://www.polyphony.org/photos/2003/engagement/">engaged</a>! Who would ever have thought that all that flirting in the <a href="http://www.skidmore.edu/academics/music/facilities/filene.html">music building</a> would actually lead something? ;-)<br /><br />Carey also illuminated me as to the etymology of my internet namesake, <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/resources/dictionary.html">esemplastic</a>. I never even knew it was connected with Samuel Taylor Coleridge.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||

<div style="clear:both;"></div>Finally back in H-town after a whirlwind trip up north. The wedding was wonderful and went off without a hitch. The reception was awesome (held in the old <a href="http://www.cambridgehotel.com/">Cambridge Hotel</a> - which, I will have you know, is the original home of <a href="http://www.cambridgehotel.com/pie.html">pie a la mode</a>). We stayed the night in their lovely <a href="http://www.cambridgehotel.com/rm115.html">Autumn Delight</a> room (which would have been all the more delightful had there not been a neighboring room with the TV on full blast all night). All in all, it was a much needed and appreciated visit (though I can't say we were sad to step off the plane into Houston's 70 degree weather, after freezing in the northeast for a few cold, soggy days.)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
