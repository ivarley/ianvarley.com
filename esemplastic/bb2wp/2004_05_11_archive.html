You know who you look like?|||
<div style="clear:both;"></div>So today at lunch, I was picking up some sandwiches at <a href="http://www.thedeliciouslife.com/bizshow.cfm?Biz=5853">my favoritest new lunch place</a> in Montrose. The dude behind the counter said:<br /><br />"Hey, you know who you look like? That dude from Phish ..."<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.alternatemusicpress.com/gifs/trey.jpg"></center><br /><br />The ensuing conversation:<br /><br />Me: "Whoa, really? I've never heard that before ..."<br /><br />Him: "Yeah, you totally ..."<br /><br />Me: " ... except for EVERY FRIGGING DAY! What are you gonna tell me next, that I look like <a href="http://www.cimko.com.tr/About/chucknorris.jpg">Chuck Norris</a>?"<br /><br />He replied that Chuck Norris was too short.<br /><br />I felt bad afterwards, he was just trying to be nice and conversational. But seriously, I had the exact same conversation last night with the dude at <a href="http://www.missionburritos.com/">Mission Burrito</a>. Do we really look that much alike?<br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.ianvarley.com/esemplastic/groove.jpg"></center><br /><br />I mean, not that I mind if we do look alike. I dig Phish, and I hear Trey is a great guy. But I mean, where are all the people going "Hey, aren't you that guy from Drop Trio?"<br /><br />Um, yeah. Thanks folks, I'll be here all week.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
