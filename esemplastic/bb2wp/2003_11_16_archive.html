<div style="clear:both;"></div>Home again, finally, after a long weekend of travel. Friday morning, the band played a store opening here in Houston (the newly remodeled <a href="http://www.specsonline.com/">Specs</a>, which I think might now indeed be the world biggest friggin' liquor store). Then we piled in 2 cars (Ron's wife Tara was along for the trip, thus necessitating 2 vehicles) and caravaned to Baton Rouge. You've got to love Texas. When we pulled up at a drive through burger place in Beaumont for lunch, I said "Have you got any veggie burgers?" to which the woman replied "We've got a BLT burger with bacon lettuce and tomato ... ?"<br /><br />We made it to Baton Rouge just in time to have a quick interview on the radio station (<a href="http://www.klsu.fm/">KLSU</a>). That was pretty neat, right when we walked in they handed us a poster for the next night's show and had us all sign it. What a rock star moment. That rock stardom was quickly dispelled when we got to the venue at 10:30 pm and it was totally empty. Doh. We played for a handful of folks, and they seemed to really like it. Not the screaming throngs we were expecting, however.<br /><br />Our next day was spend driving around Baton Rouge, watching movies and napping. Fortunately for morale, the 2nd show (at the <a href="http://www.mellowmushroom.com/">Mellow Mushroom</a>) was packed, and we had a lot of fun. Almost as much fun as playing was entertaining ourselves with the very drunk clientele at the Mellow Mushroom. One guy had a full conversation with our bass player about what kind of bass he played, etc., and then proceeded to ask me if we had a bass player. He did the exact same thing to the next band as well. The funniest part was that he was a bass player himself. ?? Wasn't playing with all 4 strings, so to speak.<br /><br />Our trip home was uneventful, though we did have the pleasure to listen to the new (pre-release) CD by Bones (aka Michael Miller), the awesome guy who put us up for 2 nights at his house, made us cookies, and generally took care of us in Baton Rouge. The Bones CD is fantastic, I can't wait to share it with everybody here in Houston (and beyond) once it's released. We also spun the new Galactic record, and old MMW record, the most recent Calexico record, and some Righteous Buddha. Good stuff. <br /><br />Now I'm settled in at home with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0345339738?v=glance">a book</a>, a wife, and a thunderstorm. I have much to be thankful for.<br /><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
