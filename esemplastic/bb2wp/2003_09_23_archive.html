<div style="clear:both;"></div>More jam bands entering my listening sphere now, like it or not ... I am listening to Umphrey's McGee for the first time (I've heard a bit here and there but never really spent any time with it) and I have to admit that love it! Similar to Phish, but with thicker arrangements and a different approach to songwriting (that I actually like a bit more than Phish).  I only have this one tune, on a sampler from <a href="http://www.homegrownmusic.com">Homegrown Music</a>. I wonder if all their stuff is like this? Through this same sampler, I learned about another band I now love, called <a href="http://www.unclesammy.com/">Uncle Sammy</a>. However, I guess I was a little too late on that one, as their web site announces they'll be breaking up this month. Doh.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
