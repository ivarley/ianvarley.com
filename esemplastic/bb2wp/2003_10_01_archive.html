<div style="clear:both;"></div>For some reason, it's been an amazingly busy couple days. Last night I stayed up late watching the numbers and comments roll in for the <a href="http://www.blogforamerica.com">Dean campaign</a>. There's so much energy in this campaign, it's unbelieveable. They raised over 5 million dollars in 10 days, and the average donation size was $86. Tonight there's a <a href="http://dean2004.meetup.com/">meetup</a> over at <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?address=2929+Kirby+Dr.&city=Houston&state=TX&zip=77098&country=us">Schlotzky's</a> that I'm going to hit. Then it's off to packing for a trip up to the northeast for my sister's wedding this weekend!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
