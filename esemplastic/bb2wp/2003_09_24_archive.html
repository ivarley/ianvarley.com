<div style="clear:both;"></div>Choices choices ... there is so much good stuff going on this week, I don't even know where to start. I wish I could be in 10 places at once.<br /><br />Tonight, <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/artists/profile.jsp?key=89">Joe LoCascio</a> (my piano teacher and probably the best pianist in Houston) is playing at the <a href="http://www.elbuenbife.com/html/buenbife2.html">Argentina Grill</a>. There's also an poetry reading / open mic at <a href="http://www.poetz.com/cgi-poetz/Calcium37.pl?Op=PopupWindow&Amount=Month&NavType=Relative&Type=Block&CalendarName=houston&Date=2003/9/24&ID=17&Source=">Helios</a> hosted by Mike McGuire, and an improv workshop with Andy (from the Ex) at MECA hosted by Dave Dove and the <a href="http://www.pofinc.org/houston/">Pauline Oliveros foundation</a> (not to mention <a href="http://members.boardhost.com/hands_up/">Hands up Houston</a>).  And if you've got time between everything else, at 6pm, Welsh band <a href="http://www.superfurry.com/">Super Furry Animals</a> will be hanging out in-store at <a href="http://www.gladmusicco.com/Cactus.htm">Cactus</a> (not playing, just hanging out while their record gets some play) before their Numbers show tonight. Free beer, hard to pass up.<br /><br />Tomorrow night is a ton of cool stuff, of which the only one I can make it to is <a href="http://www.droptrio.com/Showdates/showdates.html">my own show</a> at the <a href="http://www.twelvespot.com/">Twelve Spot</a>. But of course, the Cezanne Jazz Jam is also a great spot to hit, and <a href="http://www.phuz.com">Phuz</a> will be at <a href="http://www.sevenlounge.tv/">VII lounge</a>.<br /><br />And then Friday, there's the <a href="http://www.spahouston.org/notes1.htm">Society for the Performing Arts</a>' performance of Philip Glass's soundtrack to <a href="http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/">Koyaanisqatsi</a> (with a showing of the movie, of course), there's <a href="http://www.geocities.com/barnevelder2201/IvanTheFool.html">Ivan the Fool</a>, a cool puppet show at the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/barnevelder2201/">Barnevelder</a> that <a href="http://www.jazzhouston.com/artists/profile.jsp?key=661">Mike Switzer</a> is involved with, there's a <a href="http://www.gulfcoastmag.org/">Gulf Coast</a> reading at <a href="http://www.brazosbookstore.com/">Brazos bookstore</a><br /><br />Don't even get me started on Saturday ... Drop @ <a href="http://www.bordersstores.com/stores/store_pg.jsp?storeID=381">Borders Books & Music</a> (at 3pm), a big 1-year birthday bash at the Proletariat featuring <a href="http://www.thesinglesmusic.com">The Singles</a> (as they are still temporarily known), a daytime benefit for <a href="http://www.reprogrammusic.com">Reprogram Radio</a> ... Drop will hit the radio on the <a href="http://www.soulargrooves.com">Soular Grooves</a> show at 10pm that night, so definitely tune in for that (90.1 FM, or <a href="http://www.kpftx.org">online</a>). And <a href="http://www.trusolmusic.com/">Tru Sol</a> is at the <a href="http://www.industrycafe.net/">Industry Cafe</a>.<br /><br />Let it never be said that there's nothing to do in Houston.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
