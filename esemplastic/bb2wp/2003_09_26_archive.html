<div style="clear:both;"></div>So ... our car got broken in to last night, <i>again</i>, and they stole our stereo, <i>again</i>. Last time was a few months back, on campus over at <a href="http://www.uh.edu">U of H</a>, but this time was right out in front of our own house in the <a href="http://www.houstoncl.com/montrose/montrose.htm">Montrose area</a>, under a streetlight no less, sometime between 1:30 am and 7am. The perpetrator also ripped up the dashboard and messed up the window (not broken, thankfully). <br /><br />If the perpetrator is reading this blog, I just want to say: a) if you had just asked me for the stereo, I would have given it to you, and b) it's a <a href="http://www.kenwoodusa.com/product/product.jsp?productTypeId=18&sortBy=price&pageId=2&productId=2484">crappy stereo</a> anyhow, the CD player skips and the EQ options are pretty poor. And good luck setting the clock, man, I never figured that out. Now, can I have my <a href="http://www.deathraydavies.com/">Deathray Davies</a> CD back?<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
