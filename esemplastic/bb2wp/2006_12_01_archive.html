<div style="clear:both;"></div>So, you may remember that I started out November <a href="http://www.ianvarley.com/esemplastic/2006/11/nanowrimo.html">participating in NaNoWriMo</a>. Well ... I didn't make it. I got about 15,000 words in (towards a goal of 50,000) before realizing I was absolutely bat-guano crazy. <br /><br />BUT ... I did make 15,000 words, which is pretty good. I actually like a lot of what I wrote, and I think some of the characters really had promise. But as it turns out, writing a cohesive novel with no idea about the plot or purpose when you start is ... well, tricky.<br /><br />So, goodbye novel. Maybe I'll see you again next year.<br /><br /><center><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianvarley/303887192/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/107/303887192_1439621b74_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Laptop" /></a></center><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
