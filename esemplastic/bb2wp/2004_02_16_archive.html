<div style="clear:both;"></div>Man, I've just been cranking all day at work today. I actually pushed out a full application in a very short space of time - it's called the Recordable Accident Tracker, or RAT for short. Lets users at our branch offices punch in data about recordable accidents directly on our corporate intranet. Whee! And it generates reports! Yahoo!<br /><br />OK, so my day job isn't very exciting. I'll take what small pleasure I can get in writing elegant code that solves problems for people, even if those problems do happen to originiate somewhere in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=dilbert">dilbert</a> land. But seriously - my new programming technique is <a href="http://www.mnftiu.cc">unstoppable</a>.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div>|||
