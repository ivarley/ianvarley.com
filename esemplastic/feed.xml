That's what &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/01/09/apple-announces-iphone-stock-soars/"&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt; said about the new &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt; that was announced this morning. And they are so right. GPF and I sat around the kitchen table &lt;a href="http://www.macrumorslive.com/"&gt;watching it unfold&lt;/a&gt; in stilted real-time text messages &amp; photos from the convention center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's everything the blackberry is, plus a super-intuitive and slick input method (multi-touch), plus GPS (instant maps if you're lost!) AND an iPod (oh yeah, that old thing?) AND a cell phone. The holy grail of integration, done right like only Apple could. Just &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/phone/"&gt;watch the videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's also brilliant how they announced it - not available till June, but announced now because the FCC needs time to approve it, and they'd rather it come out this way than in an FCC filing (though I'm sure those are a barrel of laughs). What they didn't mention is that that also gives 6 months to a) work out the bugs &amp; glitches, and b) get 3rd parties to develop iPhone-targeted apps (which they can start doing immediately because the thing runs full fledged OSX!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As &lt;a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/apple/07/01/09/1857231.shtml"&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt; said, this is basically a printing press for cash for Apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the money equation work out for consumers? $499 / $599 isn't cheap for a phone. But - it's also an iPod, and a GPS, and a blackberry, and a 2-year phone contract is included in that price (though presumably you'll need to "upgrade" that to get a decent amount of talk-time). I'm thinking the answer for me will be a "yes" because I already pay for SMS and a bunch of minutes via Sprint (whose customer service really stinks), AND I'll be due for a new phone this summer anyway. I guess the devil's in the details. But even if it's more money than we're currently paying ... it's so cool, I may get one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I get my Wii, of course. :)</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ianvarley.com/esemplastic/2007/01/drool-drool.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/2543716726571152087'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/2543716726571152087'></link><author><name>Ian</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5432376.post-5412431447707279904</id><published>2006-12-17T22:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-12-17T23:12:00.255-08:00</updated><title type='text'>My Day In Photos</title><content type='html'>I've been bringing the camera along for the ride a lot more lately.

It was &lt;a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/12/11/airplanetreadmill_pr.html"&gt;picked up by BoingBoing&lt;/a&gt;, and Mark Frauenfelder published my comment on the topic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A plane doesn't increase velocity by pushing off the ground; it does so by pushing off the air. The ground is just there to keep the plane from falling into the center of the earth. (Think of seaplanes ... they can still take off despite lack of significant friction with the ground). Since the air in this example is no different from a usual takeoff, the plane would push off it and move forward as usual. The difference, however, is that as the plane started to move, the wheels of the plane would turn, and the fictional treadmill would increase in speed to match ... which would cause the wheels to turn faster, thus causing the treadmill to move faster, etc ... a mutually reinforcing system, until the wheels and the treadmill both turned to molten lava (and how fast that happens depends on how closely the treadmill could match wheel speed). Meanwhile, the body of the plane would be busy taking off as usual, unaware of the drama happening below (except, perhaps, for the smell of melting rubber).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it - the definitive word on the subject. Except for my lack of any advanced degrees in the physical sciences.

We gave it a moment's thought, then decided that we'd be OK waiting a bit longer. So instead, we went to get some food at the Magnolia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianvarley/315725782/" title="Photo Sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/111/315725782_75a2aef9ba_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="The Magnolia" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I'm going to sign up with &lt;a href="http://www.nintendofinder.com/"&gt;NintendoFinder.com&lt;/a&gt; to see if I can get any better info on where to get one.

Well ... I didn't make it. I got about 15,000 words in (towards a goal of 50,000) before realizing I was absolutely bat-guano crazy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT ... I did make 15,000 words, which is pretty good. I actually like a lot of what I wrote, and I think some of the characters really had promise.

Consider yourself warned.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've got a little &lt;a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/2006/06/23/freedbacking/"&gt;freedbacking&lt;/a&gt; for Bloglines. OK, well, actually, a lot ... this is software I use every day, so any of these little improvements would go a &lt;b&gt;long&lt;/b&gt; way with me. In order of importance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) &lt;b&gt;Show the sub name.&lt;/b&gt; When I click "j" to go to the next item, and I'm viewing a folder where I have several feeds, it's often difficult or impossible to tell what feed I'm looking at (which makes all the difference in the world, in terms of my rapid understanding of the content). I find myself clicking the mouse on the whitespace of the page and pressing the "up" arrow a few times to see it, which is extremely inefficient. I'd like it either to a) stop where you can see the folder title when you press "j", or b) float a little div with the sub name somewhere on the right side of the screen where it won't interrupt me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) &lt;b&gt;Filters.&lt;/b&gt; Build &lt;a href="http://www.feedrinse.com"&gt;Feedrinse&lt;/a&gt;-style filters in so I can reduce the number of posts I get. Feedrinse works great for that, but a) after a certain number of feeds, they make you pay, and b) it seems like logical functionality to have right in Bloglines. Plus, I'd love to still be able to see the real number of subscribers on my feed, even though I'm reading a filtered version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Improve email subscriptions.&lt;/span&gt; I use email subscriptions a lot (I have over 200 of them), but I'd really love some more management tools for them. Searching, sorting, dead feed warnings (i.e. "You've never gotten anything for this email feed"). And I know it's unlikely, but I'd really especially appreciate it if you guys gave open RSS feeds to me for the email subscriptions (even if that requires me to pay, which would make sense). My lock-in to Bloglines should be because you guys have the best service, not because you host all of my email subscriptions. (Now, of course, the best way to do it is use mail forwarding at your mail host to redirect to bloglines, instead of giving out bloglines addresses to the lists you subscribe to directly ... but I didn't figure that out until I already had over a hundred of them. Whoops.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;View all items from last view.&lt;/span&gt; Sometimes I accidentally click a feed / folder link while I'm in the middle of reading a long list of items. I want a way to go back and see exactly what I was looking at before; the droplist option that lets you show all items from this session doesn't cut it, because it might show many more (if I've had the session open all day). I just want to see the exact items I was viewing before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Pause.&lt;/span&gt; I want the ability to "pause" a subscription without removing it - it would stop showing up in my active feeds, but would show up instead in some kind of parking lot page. I could set myself a "reminder date", at which point Bloglines would ask if I want to a) dump it, b) reactivate it, or c) keep it paused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Feed search.&lt;/span&gt; I'd love the ability to search the Names &amp; descriptions of all my feeds. I have over 400 feeds, in several folders, and when I can't find the one I'm looking for by name, it takes forever. This search could be an advanced option, not shown in the regular view so as not to clutter things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Stats.&lt;/span&gt; I'd like a page that shows statistics about your feed (number of items over time, etc.) - especially for the email feeds, some of those get hard to handle.

His films have the hallmarks of the same propaganda style I decry when it represents views I don't agree with; and so, I find it hard to get behind him, even though I usually find my views (at least basically) aligned with his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the past couple weeks, he's written two pieces that really deserve to be read, even if just to spark conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a few days after the election, he wrote this piece: &lt;a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2006-11-14"&gt;A Liberal's Pledge to Disheartened Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a set of promises that we (as progressive democrats) should make to our conservative brethren. While many of the "promises" are really just unhelpful (and boorish) attacks on legitimately held conservative views, there are at least a few of them that I'd be proud to say I support, and I'd wish to see everyone of political integrity get behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We will never, ever, call you 'unpatriotic' simply because you disagree with us."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will discourage religious intolerance and fanaticism -- starting with the fanaticism here at home, thus setting a good example for the rest of the world."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"We will go after any elected leader who puts him or herself ahead of the people. And we promise you we will go after the corrupt politicians on our side FIRST."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's great stuff. As for the balance, let me just emphasize my caveat above: I think many of these "promises" are just "nyah nyah" style flamebait, particularly the bits about handguns, stem cells, and counting age from birth. I may agree with him on many of them (don't worry, my Texas neighbors: not the handguns part) ... but I think that's a particularly unhelpful way to change the minds of conservatives, which is ostensibly his goal here. A dialog may change minds; a diatribe won't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I think the list is worth reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, just today he published this letter advising America to &lt;a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?id=202"&gt;"Cut &amp; Run" in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most people have, I've been of the opinion that an immediate troop withdrawal would plunge things into chaos. But he makes a few stark points about how the operations there have, ultimately, already failed - the war of ideas has been decisively lost, even if the war of bullets is still suffering a slow burn. Many of these things I agree with strongly - most importantly, that for a people to be "liberated", they have to make it happen themselves. After impugned motives on the way in (oil? revenge? popularity ratings?) and seriously compromised execution (rising violence? massive civilian deaths? rapes?? Gitmo???), there is now no way that anyone in Iraq can view the Americans' actions with the same gratitude that we were viewed with at the end of WWII. They (collectively) look at us and want us either out or dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this piece isn't the bullying tone, but more the perspective he ends with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"A majority of us were upset and angry after 9/11 and we lost our minds. We didn't think straight and we never looked at a map. [...] We didn't know what a Sunni or a Shiite was, never even heard the words. Eighty percent of our young adults (according to National Geographic) were not able to find Iraq on the map. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at our core we are a good people. We may be slow learners, but that "Mission Accomplished" banner struck us as odd, and soon we began to ask some questions. [...] The majority now feel a deep sadness and guilt and a hope that somehow we can make make it all right again."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well said, sir. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad there's a Michael Moore to take these ideas and galvanize them. I'm also glad he's not running things at the top, because I don't think he leads from a place of quiet wisdom like truly admirable leaders do. But for heavens' sake, these pieces should be read and digested, and argued about - and, perhaps, answered by conservatives with equally compelling arguments (and a minimum of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt"&gt;FUD&lt;/a&gt; slinging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any takers?</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ianvarley.com/esemplastic/2006/11/smoore.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/116453487344990413'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/116453487344990413'></link><author><name>Ian</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5432376.post-116424628217772950</id><published>2006-11-22T17:37:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-22T17:44:42.386-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Airport Tour: Stop #2</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianvarley/303887290/" title="photo sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.flickr.com/121/303887290_018fd5f2cd_m.jpg" alt="" style="border: solid 2px #000000;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 0px;"&gt;  &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianvarley/303887290/"&gt;Nametag&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;  Originally uploaded by &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/ianvarley/"&gt;Ian Varley&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So, I've now played in &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; airports in Texas.

My hope is that with other people watching, I'll have impetus to do it more. If you see me slacking off, tell me to get back to it! :)</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://www.ianvarley.com/esemplastic/2006/10/accountability.html'></link><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/116215141023451775'></link><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5432376/posts/default/116215141023451775'></link><author><name>Ian</name></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5432376.post-116153762262754831</id><published>2006-10-22T09:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-10-22T10:20:22.683-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Sundaystuff</title><content type='html'>Found a great new Austin events site that's very "web-two-point-oh" - it's called &lt;a href="http://www.do512.com/"&gt;Do512.com&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems to already have a pretty fair number of events.

I'd share pics of that, but you're not allowed to bring in cameras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I will be taking photos of the festival this weekend, so stay tuned for that.
